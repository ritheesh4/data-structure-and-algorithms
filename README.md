Big O
-----
- Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.

What is good code ?
1. Readable
2. Scalable 

- When we talk about Big O and scalability of code, we simply mean, when we go bigger and bigger with our input, how much does the algorithm slows down. The less its slow down or lower it slows down.

O(n) --> Linear Time (Big O notation for Linear)
- This means, lets say we have an array to search, 100 items there, we might search 100 times or the loop will run for 100 times. So the chances of looping is equal to the length of the array.

- If the input increase, number operations increases linearly.
